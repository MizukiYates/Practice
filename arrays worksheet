// I don't know if this is supposed to be happening but the mover doesn't delete its old ellipse creating a line accross the screen
Mover [] dots;
void setup(){
size(300,300);
background(0);
dots = new Mover[10];
for(int i = 0; i < dots.length;i++)
{
dots[i] = new Mover();
}
}
void draw(){
for(int i = 0; i < dots.length;i++)
{
  dots[i].show() ;
  dots[i].move() ;
}
}
class Mover{
int x, y;
Mover(){
  x = 100 ;
  y = (int)(Math.random()* 300) ; 
}
void move(){
x++;
}
void show(){

ellipse(x,y,20,20);
}
}




2. A beginning programmer made a mistake with a very similar mover program. The program crashed as soon as the
program was run. What did the error message say? How would it be fixed?
Mover [] dots;
void setup(){
size(300,300);
background(0);
dots = new Mover[100];
}
void draw(){
for(int i = 0; i < dots.length;i++){
dots[i].move();
dots[i].show();
}
}
class Mover{ /* code not shown */}


NullPointerException. In seteup the array is just defined as having 100 empty spaces to put up to 100 movers in. So when it tries to run move or show it doesn't actually 
have anything that it is showing or moving. To fix you would need to change line 43 to say:
dots = new Mover[10];
for(int i = 0; i < dots.length;i++)
{
dots[i] = new Mover();
}
}
